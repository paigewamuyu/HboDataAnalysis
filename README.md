# Hbo Data Analysis
# About The Project
The project explores a HBO dataset. The purpose is to determine the audience reaction towards different TV shows in order to identify trends.
The exploration using IMDB score as a reference point as it translates to the audience reaction.
# Dependencies
The libraries imported and used were seaborn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib..pyplot.
# Description
The dataset was generated by merging two datasets using:
 ```
df = df1.merge(df2, how= 'inner', on='index')
 df
```
The data was then cleaned by deleting rows containing NaN values and checking for duplicates.
The cleaned data is converted to a new csv file and loaded for use as the new data frame.
Summary statistics for the dataframe were the generated for an overview of the dataset.
The data exploration lead to the generation of various visualisations to show relationships between columns.
For example the correlation between IMDB score and title of the TV show shown below

The  columns were seperated into numerical and categorical variables for analysis and aiding generation of histograms, boxplots and skewdness for the columns using:  ```
 ```
cat_cols=df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()
print("Categorical Variables:")
print(cat_cols)
print("Numerical Variables:")
print(num_cols)
 ```
The data was seperated into subsets bsed on year to show te effect on the IMDB score.
A new feature was to represent the age of the TV show t aid in the exploration on whether the audience prefers the older or newer TV shows.
A scatterplot and hexbin plot were generated from the age and IMDB score to provide a visualization for the analysis
the hexbin is as shown below:

# Reccomendations
The TV show Chernobyl has the highest IMDB score according to the bar plot for IMDB score and year implying the audience really likes it and hence more shows like it should be made.
The same bar plot indicates Mildred Pierce has the lowest IMDB score implying the audience did not particularly like it and hence less movies or shows like it should be made.
The peak mean IMDB score is in 2019 according to the linegraph for mean IMDB score and year implying the audience enjoys relatively newer shows.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, the success of TV shows is significantly influenced by audience feedback, as reflected in IMDb scores. Producers and creators can use this information to guide their decisions in terms of content creation, focusing on themes and styles that resonate positively with the audience while keeping an eye on current trends in the industry.
